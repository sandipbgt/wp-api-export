Every blogger at some point makes mistake, either be it at the very beginning or any turnings. Learning from mistakes can help you recover but sometimes recovery from mistakes cannot fix everything. So, it&#8217;s better to avoid such beginner mistakes from the beginning of our blogging career. Here are some of the common mistakes beginner blogger mistakes should avoid.Making yourself aware of the common mistakes that beginner blogger makes can help you a lot and saves your time too.</p>\n<h4>Why Beginner Blogger Should read this post ?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>So that you can learn from someone else mistakes.</li>\n<li>So that you don&#8217;t repeat the same mistakes.</li>\n<li>Make your blogging career strong from the beginning</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Mistakes Beginner Blogger Should Avoid</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://shoutmeloudblog.com/?attachment_id=363\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-363\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-363\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/shoutmeloudblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bloggign-mistakes.jpg?resize=500%2C356\" alt=\"Beginner Blogger\" srcset=\"http://i1.wp.com/shoutmeloudblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bloggign-mistakes.jpg?w=500 500w, http://i1.wp.com/shoutmeloudblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bloggign-mistakes.jpg?resize=300%2C214 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>1) Never Starting Your Blog.</strong></p>\n<p>This is one of the most common beginner mistakes. Many people start off excited about their new blog, even writing their first post. Then, they somehow become discouraged and never actually publish the content. If the content isn\u2019t live, then it\u2019s not a blog.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em><strong>Read: <a href=\"http://shoutmeloudblog.com/5-best-free-wordpress-themes-blog/\" rel=\"dofollow\">Best Free WordPress Themes For Your WordPress Blog</a></strong></em></span></p>\n<p><strong>2) Using Sub-Domains.</strong></p>\n<p>A sub-domain, such as yourblog.wordpress.com, tells readers that you\u2019re not dedicated to your blog. Even if you decide to use a free blogging platform, like WordPress, blogger or TypePad, you should still use your own, dedicated URL. Before you begin, register your own domain name. Blogging from your own domain shows readers that you plan for your blog to be around for the long-haul.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Putting too much time into the design.</strong></p>\n<p>The design of your blog is nowhere near as important as its content. Your design does not create traffic. Your blog\u2019s content does. So, don\u2019t waste too much time worrying about the design itself. Go ahead and choose one of the numerous free templates, and start blogging. You will always have the option of changing your design later. Just make sure there\u2019s enough relevant content available to attract search engines and readers to your blog.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em><strong>Read: <a href=\"http://shoutmeloudblog.com/increase-blog-traffic/\" rel=\"dofollow\">How To Increase Blog Traffic In Just a few days</a></strong></em></span></p>\n<p><strong>4) Not Spreading the Word.</strong></p>\n<p>The hardest days will be the early days of your blog. You may begin to get frustrated because search engines simply aren\u2019t indexing you, keeping your rankings low. Plus, no other bloggers seem to be linking to you or your content. It\u2019s your job to spread the word about your blog. Start by informing your personal email contacts and making announcements on social networks. You can also search social media sites for groups who may have an interest in your industry and post there as well.</p>\n<p><strong>5) Giving Up Too Soon.</strong></p>\n<p>Building a valuable blog audience takes time, just like anything else worth doing. Many blog experts advise beginners to give their blogs 6 months to a year before expecting serious results. In the meantime, use this time to get to know your target audience, what piques their interests and what keeps their attention. The more you get to know them, the better you\u2019ll learn to communicate with them.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em><strong>Read: <a href=\"http://shoutmeloudblog.com/get-google-adsense/\">How To Get Google Adsense Approved Easily In 1 Day</a></strong></em></span></p>\n<p><strong>6) Adding Too Many Widgets.</strong></p>\n<p>Once beginner bloggers discover how simple it is to add blog widgets, many get excited and go overboard. Resist the temptation to add numerous widgets in the beginning. Concentrate on creating valuable categories, blogrolls and content, as well as encouraging reader comments. The gadgets can be added later when you have more free time.</p>\n<p><strong>7) Monetizing Too Soon.</strong></p>\n<p>If you know anything about Google ads, you know how simple it is to throw them up on your blog. But, in the beginning, this may be a mistake. Until you build an audience, you\u2019re optimised ads will only bring in pennies daily, if you\u2019re lucky. Just stay focused on creating content that will build your audience for now. Optimisation can wait.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em><strong>Read: <a href=\"http://shoutmeloudblog.com/top-5-best-wordpress-seo-plugin/\">Top 5 Best WordPress SEO Plugin For Higher Ranking</a></strong></em></span></p>\n<p><strong>8) Not Being Original.</strong></p>\n<p>Plagiarism is a major, on-going issue with some beginner bloggers. They simply don\u2019t understand how unprofessional and unethical it is to pass someone else\u2019s writing off as your own. Your readers are savvy online users. They will notice your \u201cstolen\u201d content. And, guess what? Google and other search engines will too. Search engines will penalise you with low rankings, decreasing your traffic dramatically. So, make sure all of the content you publish is original. Both search engines, as well as your readers, will appreciate it.</p>\n<p><strong>9) Not Including Images.</strong></p>\n<p>Pictures brighten up just about any topic. They also help you illustrate things such as step-by-step instructions or processes. Images are even more valuable to long, wordy content. They help to break up the monotony of text, making the content more pleasing to the eyes. Plus, they make things seem more interesting. So, be sure to add relevant pics to your posts that include keywords for search engine optimisation.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em><strong>Read: <a href=\"http://shoutmeloudblog.com/facebook-traffic-to-blog-easy-traffic/\">Secret Tips To Drive Facebook Traffic To Your Blog</a></strong></em></span></p>\n<p><strong>10) Turning Off Comments.</strong></p>\n<p>Comments are one of the most valuable ways for your readers to interact with you. Some may post questions that catch the attention of others. You will also find many who will use the comments section to start interesting conversations, even if they\u2019re controversial. Never take this privilege away from your readers. It tells them that you would like them to take interest in what you have to say. But, you\u2019re in no way interested in their opinions or feelings. This decreases interactivity on your blog, which decreases your search engine rankings, and eventually, your traffic. So always keep a platform to engage with your readers. This builds good relation and trust with time.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em><strong>Read: <a href=\"http://shoutmeloudblog.com/how-to-make-money-blogging/\">5 Best Ways To Make Money From Your Blog</a></strong></em></span></p>\n<p>As I already said above,\u00a0in blogging we all do mistakes, out of which some cost us a lot.

It is perfect for a newbie. You don&#8217;t need to spend a single penny to start blogging on blogger platform. Just get a Gmail ID, Sign up for Blogspot, some setup, and your blog is ready.

Google have the power to shut down your blog anytime. If you violate even a single policy of blogger, you are warned by Google and if this continues they will close down your blog.</p>\n<p>Blogger has not an excellent collection of templates for your blog design.\u00a0 The templates blogger provides are not very useful and attractive.

You don&#8217;t have control over the SEO of the blog, limited features, less customization, fewer supports. If you want to create a professional website or blog using Blogspot, you will end up crying and regretting. Blogspot is not for creating and or for the long-term site. It is for the beginner to learn how to blog.</p>\n<p>One of the best thing about blogger is its security. As a part of Google, it has robust security. You don&#8217;t have to worry about anything regarding your blog&#8217;s safety.</p>\n<h3>WordPress</h3>\n<p>WordPress is a free CMS ( Content Management System).

Fortunately, very few e-commerce shoppers or visitors directly write bad reviews while most of do complaints using appropriate channels instead.</p>\n<p>It clearly indicates that if e-commerce owners cut the numbers of complaints, chances are high to raise the bar of overall performance and revenues as well. This post is about giving some wise tips or advice to stop consumer complaints before they are taking place, so let us go through.</p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-family: 'Bitstream Charter','serif';\">Complain No.1: Where Is My Order?</span></h3>\n<p>This one is the most frequently occurring complaint in the e-commerce industry. Of course, it is the most sensitive one too because when your customer is placing an order and pay for it, she is placing a lot of trust in you.</p>\n<p>Your shopper is now want to see her order as you had promised on your e-commerce store. If it is not arriving on-time and delays beyond tolerance, you surely face complaints from her.</p>\n<p>At another facet of the coin, no e-commerce owner wishes to delay in fulfilment of order and take a significant risk. There are certain circumstances, which are responsible for delays in order deliveries for e-commerce as well as brick-and-mortar stores too.</p>\n<p>Now, the question is that what is a viable solution for order related complaints?</p>\n<p>You should keep your shoppers in the loop by offering order tracking facilities in your e-commerce storefront. You can do so by creating order tracking feature on your e-commerce website or integrating 3<sup>rd</sup> party software for reliable performance.</p>\n<p>If you are using standard shipping agencies like USPS, you can integrate their APIs for real-time order status and for Map views to follow the journey of shipments or packages with live updates.</p>\n<p>For international shipment with multiple shipping methods, you need to take help of <a href=\"https://apps.shopify.com/tracktor-2\">Tracktor</a> like apps, which are offering supports for hundreds of carriers across the globe.</p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-family: 'Bitstream Charter','serif';\">Complain No.2: It is Not the Same Product that I have Seen on the Site</span></h3>\n<p>In brick-and-mortar stores, shoppers can touch, smell, see, and carry products/goods with physical sense, so they have no reason to express the lack of trust on their product purchases.</p>\n<p>It is not in the case of e-commerce. The most unfortunate thing about e-commerce is that products are in virtual spaces, not in real or physical touch. Therefore, chances of arising discrepancies are high.</p>\n<p>For instance, in the case of apparels the size, color, and fittings are known issues. You might have complaints regarding them. However, the remedy for such complaints are simple and it is product presentation in standard ways using the latest technologies.</p>\n<p>You can use a professional photographer or can do photography in professional ways to take images of your product from various angles. Optimize photos using photo editor tools and upload those on your e-commerce web store.</p>\n<p>The next important thing is writing product descriptions with the help of professional content writer or learn it to do professionally. Moreover, you can take help of modern multimedia tools such as an audio-visual presentation of products through videos, animation, and so on to augment your product different ways.</p>\n<p>For instance, you can prepare video for how to use the product or how real life customers are using your products. These all efforts can build trusts among the users that they are receiving right products from right vendors.</p>\n<p>The best policy for e-commerce owners is to be as transparent as possible and include various warnings regarding differences in display on their devices and actual products, particularly for colors, textures, and size of the products.</p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-family: 'Bitstream Charter','serif';\">Complain No.3: Where Is Your Store or Warehouse Located?</span></h3>\n<p>Pure e-commerce stores have warehouses and brick-to-click stores have physical stores with warehouses. If you have a pure e-commerce store, you must mention your address of office and warehouses to establish trusts among the visitors at the first place.</p>\n<p>If you have the brick-and-click store or e-commerce site with chains of physical stores, your contact details such as an address of the store, contact numbers, email address, and your shop registration number or taxation authority numbers are mandatory to mention on the e-commerce website.</p>\n<p>It has multiple benefits in terms of the legal trust as well as convenience for your shoppers. It has seen that many local shoppers prefer to buy on an e-commerce site and pay for the goods, but prefer to pick up the order from physical stores through a face-to-face visit.</p>\n<p>In such cases, full address and contact details with location map are the demand of today and it can please mobile users who love to drive straightly to the physical stores in their vicinity when they realize its products and quality online.</p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-family: 'Bitstream Charter','serif';\">Complain No.4: I Cannot Find My Products Easily</span></h3>\n<p>Up to this, we have seen complaints regarding post-purchase phase. Now, we will see complaints regarding e-commerce site experiences, which are few in numbers expressed properly, otherwise, visitors avoid making complaints and simply leave your site to find your competitors.</p>\n<p>If some genuine visitors express their dislikes directly to your contacts or in social media channels, you must be proactive and take it seriously to improve your performance.</p>\n<p>Product search related complaints are common when an e-commerce store is devoid of the advance search feature and comprehensive navigation schemes. You have to incorporate both methods to find your products with a few clicks and fast loading of product or category pages.</p>\n<p>Suggestive search, auto-search, faceted search, filtered search, and so on advanced search functionality integration in your in-site search engine is compulsory. Besides the main menu, you can include side menu, bottom menu, and breadcrumb like convenience for your shoppers to reach their desired products quickly.</p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-family: 'Bitstream Charter','serif';\">Complain No.5: Product Shows Out-of-Stock Notification at the End of Checkout</span></h3>\n<p>It is an issue with the stock indication. Standard e-commerce platforms like Magento, WooCommerce, and others have built-in stock indicators in the latest versions while Shopify and many needs to add suitable extensions to depict inventory levels in comprehensive ways.</p>\n<p>One interesting thing I would like to mention here that many customers place orders and after several days, they realize that the product is out of stock and may arrive after the certain time so they have to wait for it.</p>\n<p>Yes, it is the hardcore reality in modern e-commerce where poor inventory management is responsible partially and display of inventory with real-time updates is for the rest. The best prevention measure is to use an app that can display out-of-stock notifications on product pages and during checkout process with alternatives to order for future delivery when inventory appears on the web store.</p>\n<p>Stock indication helps e-commerce store in two different ways. At first place, it warns shoppers to place an order against no stock items to avoid frustrations at the end of checkout process. Another way, it offers an opportunity to place orders in advance for coming items, if your inventory management software is capable of delivering future data of stocks arriving on the web store.</p>\n<p>Recently, partial payment/invoice system is working beautifully where instalments of full payment take some longer period and it is likely that new stock arrives on the store and e-commerce managers can deliver as soon as full payment is accomplishing.</p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-family: 'Bitstream Charter','serif';\">Complain No.6: Shipping Cost Arrives at the End of Checkout Instead before Add-to-Cart</span></h3>\n<p>The majority of customers are eager to know the total cost of the products they purchase when the delivery men handover products in their hands. Many are like to do comparative shopping due to various promotional schemes running on the web with free shipping incentives.</p>\n<p>Moreover, some are much savvy and would like to know the shipping carriers and their charges to pick up the best deal. Therefore, they look for shipping calculator right from the beginning of shopping or before adding products to shopping cart.</p>\n<p>Today integrating shipping calculator is easy if you have seasoned team of e-commerce developers, and it the best remedy of such shipping cost related complaints. If you want to bring more transparency in your web store, show your shipping carriers along with charges. The best way is to have selection option for shipping methods too including shipping carriers.</p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-family: 'Bitstream Charter','serif';\">Complain No.7: Your Store Has Obscure Terms &amp; Condition</span></h3>\n<p>The aim behind writing terms and condition is to avoid conflict regarding e-commerce deals. It mainly includes the policies of e-commerce store in other words and defines how e-commerce web store like to build trusts among the users and establishes as well as nurture a long-term relationship with its patrons.</p>\n<p>Therefore, it is advisable to keep your terms and condition transparent and visitor friendly. You must be easy enough to deal with for your visitors and secure to share critical data on your storefront including transaction data.</p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-family: 'Bitstream Charter','serif';\">Complain No.8: What is Your Return Policies for Purchased Products</span></h3>\n<p>The modern e-commerce industry is using return policies as a marketing incentive and try to lure customers to keep their loyalty intact with them. Therefore, you may find \u2018free of charge return\u2019 headings in bold in many banners and e-commerce content.</p>\n<p>However, offering free return is not possible in all circumstances and need to define well that whenever free return or return with flexible terms is possible. Of course, bearing return charges can reward you in the long run, as it is considering good user experiences on e-commerce.</p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-family: 'Bitstream Charter','serif';\">Complain No.9: User Experiences of Your Website Are Not Good Enough</span></h3>\n<p>Have you visited a prestigious brick store in-person? If products are not classified in ranks and labelled properly, the store may seem a mess. You need to ask sales representative frequently and it can annoy service staff.</p>\n<p>The same goes true in the case of e-commerce. When your visitors arrived in your virtual store, she may expect the same user experiences and usability. Therefore, it is better for you to plan easy and comprehensive navigation schemes to draw your target audience towards their goals/products.</p>\n<p>Give them uncluttered and highly informative content. Use smart UI elements to convey your messages or intentions smartly. Design site architecture such a way that it makes screen transitions and screen flows smooth.</p>\n<p>Therefore, you need to hire highly experienced and skilled e-commerce development team to achieve excellent user experiences.</p>\n<h3><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-family: 'Bitstream Charter','serif';\">Complain No.10: Your Site is Not Mobile Friendly</span></h3>\n<p>Recently, Google has included mobile friendliness as a ranking factor and alerted all website owners to either go for responsive web design (RWD) or dedicated mobile website development.</p>\n<p>Apart from these, mobiles Internet has a huge audience, and the majority of shopping takes place through mobiles, via web browsers or apps. If you want to grab such lucrative opportunities available from a vast audience on mobiles, you must have your e-commerce store mobile friendly and responsive to give native mobile experiences using hardware and software capabilities of mobile devices including smartphones and tablets.</p>\n<p>Test your website thoroughly on various smartphones and tablets with cross-device, cross-platform, and cross-browser compatibility, so your visitors have no room to make complaints regarding responsiveness or mobile friendliness of your e-commerce storefront.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>Complaints on e-commerce stores are not a new thing. Many avoid it all while smart e-commerce owners are take it as an opportunity to improve the performance of storefront and their services to sustain in highly competitive environment online.</p>\n<p>The best way to cut the chances of complaints prior to they happen to create e-commerce store with the help of experienced, skilled, and talented e-commerce web developers and designers.</p>\n<span class=\"et_bloom_bottom_trigger\"></span>",

Like AdSense, you won\u2019t have to apply for a number of times to get a letter of approval from their system. This ad network can be used by anyone who has a good blog with quality content and decent traffic.</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Also Read : <a href=\"http://shoutmeloudblog.com/facebook-traffic-to-blog-easy-traffic/\" rel=\"dofollow\">Drive Facebook Traffic To Blog Secret Revealed</a></strong> </span></em></p>\n<p>It\u2019s quick. I mean that you won\u2019t have to wait weeks to start seeing ads.
