# wp-api-export
The json output from WordPress api contains lots of useless fields which only adds to the size of json file.
This script helps you export only important fields to a json file so that the size of json file is less and 
you can upload this json file to your site. Since the size of the json file will be very less and it contains only
the required fields, it will ease the process of parsing wp json api.
